# personal-website

This is a personal website to show my projects, resume, and blog

## Next JS

For this project I am trying to focus on creating a full static site using Next. I plan to use next so I may easily create markdown posts and simply rebuild the website to get full urls and pages automatically without having to hard code each individual page.
